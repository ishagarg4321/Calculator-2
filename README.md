# Calculator
I created this project, a simple calculator, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator features a user-friendly interface with buttons for digits and operators, as well as a display screen. Through this project, I refreshed my knowledge of event handling, DOM manipulation, and the basics of web development.
